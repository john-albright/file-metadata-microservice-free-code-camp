This project is the fifth of five projects to be completed for FreeCodeCamp's fifth of six JavaScript certificate: [Back End Development and APIs](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/#back-end-development-and-apis-projects). To use the API, the user must upload a file to the main form. A JSON object with the file's name, size, and type is returned if a file is successfully uploaded.
